Brown, Jr. Salinity Laboratory",Amaani Lyle,Amaani.Lyle@usda.gov,"The event celebrated decades of research at the laboratory, where ARS teams have pioneered irrigation practices to optimize crop production, leverage conservation through recycled water, and minimize land degradation caused by the omnipresence of natural and man-made salinization, the overabundance of salt. Salinization is the buildup of salts and other trace elements in irrigated soils that reduces the productivity of croplands, constituting a long-standing threat to farming in the semi-arid regions of the American West, parts of the Midwest, and throughout the world. The Salinity Laboratory’s innovation and leadership in understanding salt-affected soil-plant-water systems for the conservation and protection of our land and water resources and the maintenance of a viable, permanent irrigated agriculture has garnered acclaim from both USDA leadership and UC Riverside collaborators. “This milestone anniversary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture George E. Brown, Jr., Salinity Laboratory marks a storied history of our mission to overcome water quality and water scarcity constraints on agriculture and human health,” said Dr. Simon Liu, ARS Administrator. “Our researchers’ work has yielded palpable solutions to address climate change, drought, and competition for resources -- factors that reduce the availability of irrigation water and compound risks posed by salinization.” ARS Research Leader Todd Skaggs echoed the importance of appropriate salinity control. “To meet increasing demands for food amid limited soil and water resources, the nation and much of the world community will continue to look to the USDA Salinity Laboratory for salinity expertise, water quality research, and applications to solve these problems,” Skaggs said. “Protection of soil resources will become even more vital as water conservation, efficiency and quality assurance continue to increase.” According to Skaggs, current research focus areas have earned the lab a vanguard position in addressing and eradicating per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals of concern whose presence in recycled water may lead to the introduction of these harmful compounds into the human food chain if such waters are used for agricultural crop irrigation. “Even low levels of PFAS may accumulate in soils over time and be absorbed by crop roots,” Skaggs explained. “Our team is therefore developing a low-cost, low-energy, environmentally-friendly treatment system for the removal of PFAS from recycled water, and it’s being optimized for application at the greenhouse scale, potentially allowing for production of PFAS-free crops for human consumption.” Skaggs also recounted research inflection points in the 1960s and 1970s when ARS scientists quantified the salinity response of a wide variety of agricultural crops and demonstrated that soil salinity could be managed with significantly less water than used in conventional irrigation practices, setting the stage for substantial water conservation. “This research enabled the selection of suitable crops for a given irrigation water quality and the data remain the most comprehensive information available on relative crop salt tolerances,” he said. By the 1990s, the Salinity Laboratory developed benchmark methods for mapping and monitoring soil salinity across swaths of U.S. farms and agricultural regions, irrigated lands that produce 30% of the nation's food and fiber and practically all of the nation's fruits and vegetables. The 30th anniversary ceremony highlighted but a fraction of the lab’s deep roots. In 1937, the United States Regional Salinity Laboratory was established at the base of Mount Rubidoux in the city of Riverside before adopting a new moniker, United States Salinity Laboratory, in 1951.  In 1986, Congressmen George Brown, Jerry Lewis, and Al McCandless of California introduced legislation to replace the aging U.S. Salinity Laboratory with a modern facility on the UCR campus, which supported the project by leasing to the federal government a 7.5-acre site for 50 years at $1 per year. Groundbreaking occurred in 1992 before the facility officially opened in 1995.  In 2000, the laboratory name would change once more to George E. Brown, Jr., Salinity Laboratory in memory of Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. The laboratory has the distinction of being the only facility in the country specifically devoted to agricultural and environmental issue analysis through basic research on saline and alkali soils, including related reclamation, irrigation, drainage and soil management.   Following the ceremony was an open house highlighting current research including breeding of salt-tolerant alfalfa, precision agriculture, and greenhouse-scale treatment systems for removing PFAS from irrigation water. ARS and UC Riverside researchers have maintained collaborative relationships, sharing vital resources to achieve common research objectives through cooperative research programs.

(Image courtesy of Burns & McDonnell) Collaborations between ARS, USDA’s chief in-house research agency, and UC Davis began in 1956 with the location of the Crops Pathology and Genetics Research Unit (CPGRU) led by ARS Plant Pathologist, Dr. Austin Goheen, on campus to research grape viruses. ARS scientists have since fanned across several UC Davis departments, including Plant Pathology, Viticulture and Enology; Entomology and Nematology; Plant Sciences; and Land, Air and Water Resources, which has facilitated many collaborations that have benefited various stakeholders in industries that include almond, walnut, rice, and grapes. ARS’s presence on campus has since grown to over 30 scientists with supporting staff across the four research units and the Western Human Nutrition Research Center. Strong collaborative research efforts between university extension specialists, farm advisors, and faculty will continue with the move to the ARTC. “This research will benefit growers, commodity groups, agricultural businesses, and U.S. consumers who rely on ARS to find solutions to agricultural and environmental problems,” said Dr. Amisha Poret-Peterson, CPGRU Acting Research Leader. “It’s incredible to celebrate current and future cooperative research among ARS, groundwater sustainability agencies, UC Davis researchers, and stakeholders in diverse specialty realms such as tree nut, rice, and beekeeping industries.” ARS remains committed to nationwide infrastructure modernization, empowering researchers to address agricultural challenges from animal science and crop production to climate change and sustainable farming practices.

October 16 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/agricultural-research-service-develops-long-term-roadmap-for-pfas-in-us-agriculture/,Agricultural Research Service Develops Long-Term Roadmap for PFAS in U.S. Agriculture,Autumn Canaday,Email not found,"ARS, its Center of Excellence for Environmental Monitoring and Mitigation, and the University Maine, collaborated recently during a three-day workshop to bring together more than 150 interagency researchers, state partners, university partners and other subject matter experts to engage in discussion and identify key research and innovative solutions that address the top challenges PFAS poses to agriculture, agroecosystems, food systems, and farming communities. Many within the agricultural community are facing new challenges when PFAS chemicals are detected within their farms, resulting in this being a new challenge to farmers’ continued capacity to sustain healthy soil and water on their farms, as well as continued capacity to provide safe and dependable food and fiber supplies to our nation and the world. The suggested long-term roadmap solutions for improving these circumstances include finding new means of detecting when PFAS contamination is a problem, better understanding of how it moves through the agricultural system, and innovating new ways to interrupt that movement or remove the chemicals before they can do harm. Other topics of discussion at the workshop included a strategy for data standardization and integration, how to develop scientific solutions to management of municipal biosolids, and ways of effectively removing existing PFAS chemicals from the production environment. “The meeting’s focus on the gap between PFAS challenges and solutions has empowered and offered hope to ARS, its partners and sister agencies - to address and resolve agriculture-centric problems arising from the use of PFAS in our communities and everyday consumer products,” said ARS Senior Management Advisor, Dr. David Knaebel. “The workshop’s overarching impact will assist the U.S. agricultural research community and stakeholders to find creative and innovative ways to mitigate and remediate a rapidly growing PFAS challenge in U.S. agriculture and food systems.” PFAS is a class of man-made chemicals that have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries around the globe, including in the United States, since the 1940s. The chemical has been placed in the category of “forever chemicals’ because they bioaccumulate in animals and plants and do not breakdown naturally in the animals or plants or in the environment. These chemicals in agricultural landscapes can cause food producers numerous challenges that require innovative scientific solutions from agriculture research, research and developments, and strategic partnerships. “Currently, our data shows that PFAS is an environmental hazard that does not come from agriculture,” said Acting Assistant Administrator Marlen Eve. “But, producers need efficient, cost-effective ways to deal with the challenges when it is detected in our agricultural soils and waters.” Federal and stakeholder workshop attendees plan to move forward with next steps by crafting documents that will communicate solutions to the ag research community – especially in locations where PFAS has critical impacts on agriculture – and to engage in partnerships to realize those research solutions into impactful tools and practices for producers and the agricultural community. ""The University of Maine is pleased to expand our partnership with USDA ARS to find solutions to this national environmental crisis. With our collective expertise — supported by the ingenuity and resolve of our researchers and students — we can accelerate breakthroughs in basic and applied science that will result in new tools and strategies for protecting food systems in Maine and beyond."" said Joan Ferrini-Mundy, Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation for the University of Maine System and President of the University of Maine.  ""Together, we will also expand each other's research capacities, grant funding efforts and infrastructure, all of which will be essential for mitigating the spread of PFAS and other toxic compounds like it. Thank you to U.S. Senator Susan Collins for securing funding for the Center and for her ongoing support of research informing practical solutions for rural farmers and communities."" ARS will continue to expand its PFAS research to address its impact on U.S. agriculture. Future research will ensure that the nation maintains a safe and abundant high quality food supply that is undergirded by sustainable natural resources.

October 15 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/new-oat-ready-for-active-duty-against-crown-rust-disease/,New Oat Ready for Active Duty Against Crown Rust Disease,Jan Suszkiw,Jan.Suszkiw@usda.gov,"A team of Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and university scientists has released two new oat germplasm lines to shore up the cereal crop’s defenses against its most devastating fungal disease, known as “crown rust.” The team specifically created the oat lines so that they can be crossed with elite commercial varieties to fortify them with new genetic sources of resistance to crown rust, which is caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae. Crown rust is a plague of oat worldwide and can inflict grain yield losses of up to 50 percent in unprotected crops. The team announced its development of the resistant oat germplasm lines—dubbed CDL-111 and CDL-167—in the May 2024 issue of the Journal of Plant Registration, culminating more than 25 years of germplasm screening, plant genetic mapping, selective breeding and evaluation in greenhouse and field trials. “Currently, the majority of the oat varieties with rust resistance carry a gene or two for resistance (often referred to as seedling resistance) to a specific isolate of crown rust,” said Shahryar Kianian, a co-author on the journal paper and research leader of the ARS Cereal Diseases Laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota. However, the crown rust fungus is a genetically diverse pathogen and highly adept at evolving into virulent new forms, called races. This can happen so quickly that the average productive life of an oat variety with seedling resistance is between three and five years, necessitating the use of chemical fungicides in conventional production systems. Unchecked, the fungus infects the lower leaves and sometimes the sheafs of vulnerable oat plants, forming round- to oval-shaped pustules packed with masses of orangish spores that can be carried away by wind or rain. Damage to leaves can diminish photosynthesis and disrupt the movement of sugars from the leaves to developing grain, shriveling it and reducing feed value. . ARS and university scientists have released two new lines of oat to better fortify this important grain crop’s defense against the fungus that causes ""crown rust"" disease. To even the odds in the oat plant’s favor, the team resorted to a plant breeding strategy called “gene stacking” (or “pyramiding”). A key part of that strategy involved making a series of crosses between a cultivated oat variety and wild relatives, one known as lopsided oat, which carry genes for “adult plant resistance.” “Adult plant resistance, sometimes referred to as ‘slow rusting,’ provides the oat plant some immunity—but not complete immunity,” Kianian said. “In this case, the selection pressure on the pathogen to change is reduced, and the plant is not damaged much so that it can still produce and yield grain for the growers.” All told, the team stacked offspring plants derived from crosses with three genes for adult plant resistance to crown rust. They then subjected the offspring plants to a trial by fire, of sorts, starting in 2020. In essence, this involved growing them in nursery plots of common buckthorn, a secondary host for crown rust and known source of outbreaks. In the plots, under intense pressure from the disease, two lines of offspring plants consistently fared better than the others, namely, CDL-111 and CDL-167. The sturdy oat lines have since been propagated for their seed, which is available for use in variety development programs under a material transfer agreement with ARS, Kianian said. This is to ensure the effectiveness of the gene-stacking strategy if the oat lines are crossed with commercial varieties—regardless of whether they already possess seedling resistance to crown rust. By adhering to this requirement, plant breeders can arm elite oat varieties adapted to particular production regions with a one-two punch against the crown rust fungus—a “jab” via seedling resistance and a “right hook” with adult plant resistance. “For this, we are also providing molecular markers linked to the three genes that can be used in selecting the lines that carry them,” added Kianian, who collaborated with Eric Nazareno and Kevin Smith—both with the University of Minnesota—Melanie Caffe (South Dakota State University), Roger Caspers (ARS), Howard Rines (ARS, deceased) and Marty Carson (ARS, deceased). Carson started some of the oat work 20 years ago, continuing much of it after retirement, Kianian noted.

October 1 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/targeted-grazing-a-successful-low-cost-method-to-manage-cheatgrass-when-timed-properly/,"Targeted Grazing, A Successful & Low-Cost Method to Manage Cheatgrass When Timed Properly",Maribel Alonso,Maribel.Alonso@usda.gov,"October 1, 2024 Targeted livestock grazing is a successful and cost-efficient method to manage cheatgrass in the U.S. western Great Plains when timed to coincide with cheatgrass growth rather than based solely on the time of year, according to a recent study published by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL). Findings show the targeted grazing window lasts approximately 38 days in the spring, with some variation depending on the year and location. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an annual grass native to Eurasia that has become one of the most problematic invasive species in the western U.S. This invasive species outcompetes native vegetation in the spring, and after completing its growth, it dries into fine fuels during the summer, leading to more frequent, widespread wildfires. One low-cost method is known to help manage this problem. Early spring targeted grazing, where cattle are allowed to graze cheatgrass early in the season at the right time, can help limit seed production and reduce the competitiveness of cheatgrass. However, what is the right timing for this grazing method to be successful? ARS Research Ecologist Dana Blumenthal, one of the co-authors of the recently published paper, explains a key finding of the study, “Cattle are very predictable in when they like to eat cheatgrass. Producers can effectively graze it from when it’s four inches tall until it’s done flowering, and the seeds are hardening up. That is a window of about a month to a month and a half. The window moves around from year to year, so it’s important to use cheatgrass growth as a guide for when to graze rather than calendar dates.” Spring heifer grazing on cheatgrass. (Photo courtesy of Julie Kray, ARS.) Researchers at the ARS’ Rangeland Resources & Systems Research facility (with locations in Colorado and Wyoming) and the UNL’s Panhandle Research and Extension Center collected data from mixed-grass prairie sites in the western Great Plains, including Nebraska and Wyoming, over a period of four years. The scientists identified pastures with areas of cheatgrass intermixed with native plant communities and grazed them with yearling cattle from April through June. Samples of fecal material from the grazing cattle were collected twice a week and analyzed to determine the proportion of different grass species in their diets. Researchers measured vegetation phenology (height and flowering stage), forage quality, and biomass of cheatgrass and coexisting native plant species. These measurements helped them compare the differences in cattle selection for plant species and forage quality over the four years. “We were surprised by how late in the season the cattle kept using cheatgrass. That’s really helpful because it gives producers more time to get cattle out into cheatgrass areas and have an impact,” said Blumenthal. Results of this four-year study showed that grazing can be timed effectively by keeping track of two easily observable cheatgrass characteristics – height at the beginning of the grazing window and seed maturity later on. The resulting grazing windows, on average across the years of this study, were seven days longer in the western Nebraska site compared to the southeastern Wyoming site. In terms of impact, results showed that targeted grazing in the early spring can reduce seed production of cheatgrass by as much as 77 percent when compared to summer grazing. Furthermore, spring targeted grazing can lead to favorable cattle weight gains due to higher crude protein and energy in cattle diets during this period. “Moving forward, we’d like to learn in which years grazing has the largest effect on cheatgrass seed production. Is it when cattle eat more cheatgrass because the plants are larger, or when cheatgrass is already struggling to grow, for example, in a drought?” said Julie Kray, an Agricultural Science Research Technician with the Rangeland Resources & Systems Research facility. “We know that multiple years of targeted grazing will be needed to control cheatgrass, but there may be certain years in which it is more important to prioritize grazing it.” Visit “Targeted grazing to control cheatgrass in mixed-grass rangeland” for more details about this study.

Entomologist Pat Dowd and Molecular Biologist Eric Johnson—both at the ARS National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois—conducted the study as a follow up to one they did in 2022 with field (dent) corn, which is grown for livestock consumption and other uses. Results from the 2022 study indicated resistance to fungi that cause Fusarium disease in some lines of field corn can diminish the effectiveness of the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana, which can be sprayed onto the crop as a biopesticide that kills caterpillar pests such as European corn borers and fall armyworms. However, not all of the Fusarium-resistant dent corn lines tested had a corresponding decline in the Beauveria fungus’s caterpillar-killing performance. Some corn lines also withstood the insect pests’ feeding damage, leaving open the possibility these lines carried the right combination of genes for benefiting from both disease resistance and compatibility with Beauveria. Caterpillar stage of European corn borer infected with the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana. (Photo by Keith Weller) Follow-up studies with sweet corn reflect a similar possibility with respect to the genes they possess, according to Dowd and Johnson. In those studies, biopesticide applications of Beauveria killed 12 to 58 percent of European corn borer and fall armyworm caterpillars. However, as with dent corn, the level of insecticidal activity depended on which of 14 lines of Fusarium-resistant hybrid or inbred sweet corn had been treated. In some sweet corn lines, for example, signs of high levels of disease resistance in the form of smaller dead spots on Fusarium-infected leaves were associated with increases in the percentage of caterpillars killed by the fungus two days after application. In other types of sweet corn that were less resistant, larger dead spots corresponded to lower levels of caterpillar control. Caterpillar control also varied depending on which of two Beauveria strains were used, an observation that underscores the need for continued study on how these subtleties can translate to practical data growers can use in choosing sweet corn lines offering both Fusarium resistance and high levels of insecticidal activity using the beneficial fungus. Culture of the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana. (Photo by Keith Weller) Finding that “sweet spot” in sweet corn would be especially important to organic growers, who cannot use synthetic pesticides and have fewer options for disease and insect control than in conventional production systems. “The results of gene expression studies comparing sweet corn hybrids with more and less desirable combinations of Fusarium resistance and Beauveria efficacy were recently received,” said Dowd. “These results will help identify favorable combinations of genes that will help guide the breeding of sweet corn varieties to produce ones that have good resistance to Fusarium and are more compatible with the use of Beauveria.” The researchers detailed their findings in the January 2024 issue of the journal Organic Agriculture.

Kelsey Graham, an ARS Pollinating Insect Research Unit scientist, co-led the collaborative, intensive wild bee study at the University of Michigan’s E.S. George Reserve with a sampling period covering 1921 to 2018, which in tandem with advanced computer analyses revealed long-term bee population trends that may hold the keys to new and enhanced conservation approaches. “These studies point to clear indicators of an urgent need for diligent and consistent conservation efforts to protect bee diversity, which is crucial for our ecosystem health, human health and agricultural productivity,” Graham said. In a recent publication of Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Graham’s research article “A century of wild bee sampling: historical data and neural network analysis reveal ecological traits associated with species loss,” explains how the study reached inflection points along the way, finding alarming declines in species richness, evenness and overall bee community diversity. Researchers also found that 64% of the more common bee species exhibited a more than 30% decline in abundance. “In 1972 and 1973, the late zoologist Francis C. Evans detected 135 bee species, compared to our recent surveys in 2017 and 2018, which recorded only 90 species, with just 58 species present in both sampling periods,” Graham noted. “These samplings indicate a substantial shift in the bee community composition.” Mikayla Ward, an undergraduate research technician at Michigan State University, collects bees using an insect net in September 2018 at the E.S. George Reserve. (Photo courtesy of Kelsey Graham, ARS) To better understand why some species disappeared from the preserve, the ARS team and its partners leveraged neural networks, which determined that certain types of bees were more likely to vanish. Specifically, researchers discovered that oligolectic ground-nesting bees (meaning, bees that collect pollen from a few types of plants and nest in the ground) and kleptoparasitic bees (who steal food from other bees) are most vulnerable. In comparison, the study found polylectic cavity-nesting bees (or bees that collect pollen from various plants and nest in cavities) are more likely to remain at the preserve. Similarly, the findings demonstrated that bees active for longer periods each year have a better chance of remaining in the community if they collect pollen from a variety of plants. In short, bees with certain traits, such as being picky about food, will continue to struggle compared to their more flexible counterparts. Wild bees on flowers found at the E.S. George Reserve, Livingston County, Michigan. (Photo courtesy of Kelsey Graham, ARS) Scientists also noted the significance of climate response, as bee species in the contemporary sampling period had a more southerly overall distribution compared to the historic community, indicating communities are shifting in response to warming temperatures. This study, Graham explained, exhibits the utility and importance of publicly available historical long-term data in deciphering complex indicators of bee population trajectories, findings that may have otherwise been obscured in a lesser scope and timeframe. “Combining traditional analysis techniques with neural networks helped us reveal shifts in geographic ranges and declines in bee abundance and diversity as they relate to species traits,” Graham said. “Such analyses help our understanding of bee population trends to inform the science and practice of bee conservation.""

Sainju, Brett L. Allen, and Jalal D. Jabro evaluated the effect of three long-term (34-year project) dryland cropping systems on GHG emissions and crop yields in the U.S. northern Great Plains. The objective was to evaluate improved cropping systems like continuous cropping, which involves growing crops annually and eliminating the summer fallow (unplanted field) period, for GHG emissions and sustainable crop yields in dryland conditions.   ""The study revealed that long-term no-till continuous cropping systems can reduce GHG emissions while sustaining crop yields compared to the conventional till crop-fallow system, which is the traditional two-year crop rotation of dryland farming in the Northern Great Plains,"" explained Sainju. A scientist is sampling gas to evaluate the effect of long-term dryland cropping systems on GHG emissions and crop yields in the U.S. northern Great Plains. (Image courtesy of Upendra Sainju). As the demand for agricultural production increases, it is becoming more important to mitigate GHG emissions from croplands. Certain cropping systems, management practices, and use of nitrogen-based fertilizers add to the total emissions of N2O (nitrous oxide) and CH4 (methane) that contribute to the approximate 10 percent of the total GHG emissions coming from the agricultural sector. Implementing innovative agricultural strategies that can maintain or increase crop yields while reducing GHG emissions has become critical. This is especially important in arid and semi-arid regions, which make up one-third of the global arable land and account for a significant portion of GHG emissions coming from crop production.   Scientists conducted the study on three different dryland cropping systems that had been producing crop yields and affecting soil health for 34 years. The three systems included no-till continuous spring wheat, no-till spring wheat-pea, and conventional till spring wheat-fallow. The study tested N2O and CH4 gas emissions twice a week to once a month throughout the year and analyzed carbon sequestration rates from 2012 to 2019 and crop yields, GHG balance, and yield-scaled GHG balance from 2016 to 2018. Overall, the no-till continuous cropping systems reduced net GHG balance by 66-149% compared to the conventional till crop-fallow system. In looking at the two no-till continuous cropping systems studied, Sainju noted, “Although the no-till continuous nonlegume cropping increased carbon sequestration rate and reduced GHG balance and yield-scaled GHG balance, it reduced crop yield due to increased weed and pest pressure and enhanced soil acidity compared to the no-till legume-nonlegume rotation. Therefore, no-till legume-nonlegume rotation is an ideal cropping system to enhance crop yield and reduce GHG emissions compared to no-till continuous nonlegume cropping system in dryland cropping systems of the U.S. northern Great Plains.”  The study is part of USDA-ARS ongoing long-term research on dryland cropping systems.

The warmer and more unpredictable weather has been a source of instability on U.S. farms. ARS agroecologists turned to history for a solution to this challenge, which inspired them to better understand the benefits of crop rotations. Growing a sequence of different crops in rotation has been practiced for millennia. Crop rotations can rebuild soil health, fight pests and diseases, and spread-out risk of various pests and crop disease. Crop rotation also increases the sustainability of agricultural systems and reduces risk from increasingly adverse weather. However, widespread adoption of diverse crop rotations is limited by economic uncertainty, lack of incentives, and inadequate information about long-term outcomes. ARS researchers compiled data from 20 long-term experiments spanning up to six decades to compare outcomes from different crop rotations across North America. Their aim was to assess changes in outcomes under different growing conditions for individual crops, like corn or soybean, in the crop rotations. They also looked at the outcomes of the complete rotation as a whole—not just the components. By examining both, they could quantify the benefits and trade-offs of crop rotations. Outcomes tended to be better for individual crops when grown in more diverse crop rotations across all growing conditions. Outcomes of complete rotation depended on which crops were grown in the crop rotation. This shows that the composition of crop rotations was a bigger factor than individual crop performance. Diverse rotations improved outcomes of complete rotations under poor growing conditions. This illustrates how diverse rotations can reduce the risk of crop loss in a changing climate. “Our results add to the growing body of evidence that is essential to removing the barriers that prevent adoption of sustainable farming practices,” said ARS Ecologist Dr. Katherine Muller. “To our knowledge, no long-term, multi-site studies have attempted to understand the effect of changing the rotation on the performance of both the complete rotation and its component crops simultaneously.” Many farmers face steep hurdles to diversify their crop rotations. More diverse rotations may make management more complex and may require new equipment. Farmers may also need to learn how to grow new crops and develop an understanding of how the crops fit in their operation. Farmers can benefit since more diverse rotations can reduce the amount of fertilizer or pesticides needed to maintain productivity. This is welcome news for farmers facing another source of instability: price swings for nitrogen fertilizer. Though effective, more diverse rotations may take years to show results, which is why long-term agricultural field experiments are a valuable source of evidence. The DRIVES Network (Diverse Rotations Improve Valuable Ecosystem Services) has combined data from 20 long-term experiments to investigate the impacts of crop diversity across multiple regions and production systems. The DRIVES Network is expanding the number of experiments in their database, which will help farmers by providing estimates of the benefits and costs of managing more diverse rotations. In addition to economic performance, the DRIVES Network will also provide evidence of how diverse rotations can reduce the vulnerability of cropping systems to adverse weather. By pairing long-term yield data with weather variables, like vapor pressure deficit or heat stress, researchers will be able to show how and when vulnerability is being reduced. “Long-term field experiments are national treasures for capturing dynamics in slow-moving variables like soil characteristics, or responses under erratic conditions, like droughts. Both of these variables are critical to understanding how agricultural systems can adapt to climate change,” said North Carolina State University Agroecology Professor Dr. Ann Bybee-Finley, who began this research while completing her post-doctoral studies at ARS. “The DRIVES Network aims to connect data from long-term experiments with crop rotations across North America and make it available to the public.” This research, highlighted in this month’s One Earth journal, will continue within ARS and with research partners at North Carolina State University, University of California Berkeley, Rice University, The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, University of California Davis, Iowa State University, University of Minnesota, The Pennsylvania State University, The Ohio State University, University of Tennessee, University of Wisconsin – Madison, Michigan State University, and University of Guelph.

Scientists modified the yeast’s genetic makeup with “coding” to make an enzyme on its outer surface that kills or inhibits the growth of the bacteria—microbial rivals whose release of acetic and lactic acids can keep the fermentation process from achieving its peak ethanol production capacity. “These bacteria are found everywhere in the environment, especially on plant material. They are actually responsible for the fermentation of vegetables to make products like sauerkraut and pickles,” explained Shao-Yeh Lu, a research microbiologist with ARS’ National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois. “Unfortunately, the acetic acid and lactic acid produced by these same bacteria in a bioethanol fermentation facility will cause stress and inhibit the growth of the baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is responsible for the production of ethanol.” Ethanol is considered a cleaner-burning alternative to fossil fuels such as gasoline because its greenhouse gas emissions are 40 percent lower, by some estimates. Unlike fossil fuels, ethanol can be derived from renewable resources, namely, plant-based sources of sugar (e.g., corn) and cellulosic fiber (e.g., miscanthus grass). Estimates vary, but there are between187 and 198 ethanol biorefinery plants nationwide with a total production capacity of more than 17 billion gallons annually. However, meeting the demand for renewable fuels such as ethanol necessitates that the systems in place for producing them be as efficient as possible. Bacteria that infiltrate these fermentation systems primarily feed on glucose sugars in the corn mash—the same ones the yeast helps convert into ethanol. However, this bacterial “bullying” can diminish the yeast’s conversion of glucose into ethanol by an estimated 16 to 42 percent. In biorefinery plants, this can necessitate a shutdown for cleaning and the use of antibiotics to kill the bacteria at an approximate cost of $4.5 million annually in lost revenues for a facility with a 100-million-gallons-per-year capacity. ORISE post-doctoral researcher Maulik Patel prepares for yeast for corn mash fermentation experiment. (Photo courtesy of Moses Martinez, ARS) “Current methods for eliminating bacterial contaminants in bioethanol production heavily rely on the prophylactic use of antibiotics,” Lu said. “However, this approach is not sustainable in the long term, as prolonged antibiotic use can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.” So, Lu and colleagues decided to even the microbial playing field. They did this by modifying a baker’s yeast strain with a gene they discovered for making endolysin, a specialized enzyme that kills the bacteria on contact. In lab-scale trials, use of the endolysin-making yeasts reduced the presence of the bacteria by 85 percent compared to a control group of the yeasts that hadn’t been genetically modified. On average, this reduced acetic and lactic acid levels in the mash by as much as 40 percent and 71 percent, respectively. Ethanol production increased by as much as 40 percent. According to Lu, modifying yeast to produce endolysin—either on their surface or secreted—is likely to be more cost-effective than adding bulk amounts of the enzyme to contaminated corn mash. Additional research is needed to fully ascertain its potential commercial use, but if validated through larger-scale trials, the endolysin-wielding yeasts could offer an alternative to antibiotics or other costly chemical cleansers. Lu published a paper detailing the advance in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology together with co-authors Siqing Liu, Kristina Glenzinski and Christopher Skory—all with the ARS Center in Peoria—and Maulik Patel, with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Email: Maribel.Alonso@usda.gov August 13, 2024 The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) is one of the most widely popular butterfly species in North America. We are accustomed to seeing its beautiful orange wings with black-veined outlines flying in gardens and wildflower fields during the summer season.  Can you envision the summers without the monarch butterfly? Imagine the impact on the flora and ecosystem diversity of North America if this iconic species became extinct. To ensure this imaginative but plausible scenario can be preventable, USDA scientists at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Weed and Insect Biology Research Unit, in Fargo, North Dakota, developed the first known cryopreservation protocol for the successful long-term storage of monarch butterfly germplasm, specifically for preserving germ cells (spermatozoa or sperm cells). More importantly, the technique used in this protocol allows for the preserved samples to remain viable and highly intact post-cryopreservation. “An important aspect of insect conservation is habitat conservation. Our research is a new approach to conservation through germplasm cryopreservation,” explained Courtney Grula, a scientist at the Weed and Insect Biology Research Unit. “This study is the first to implement a technique to extract semen from the male reproductive tract in insects, a common technique used in mammals.” The viable sperm cells can one day be used with artificial insemination to bring back this species of butterflies in the event of a population loss. Although more studies are needed to develop an artificial insemination protocol using cryopreserved sperm cells from male butterflies, the study shows that this protocol is a viable method for germplasm conservation in this and similar species. Furthermore, ARS researchers in Fargo are assessing artificial insemination techniques for female butterflies using cryopreserved sperm cells from male butterflies. The monarch butterfly. USDA scientists are collaborating with stakeholders to preserve this iconic butterfly species in North America. (Photo courtesy of Getty Images) The monarch butterfly population was classified as an endangered species in North America by The International Union for Conservation of Nature. This was due to a rapid population decline that was observed from 1996 to 2014, followed by its stabilization over the past decade. Even though the current numbers are at a level of least concern, the decreasing trend has not stopped. Estimating the exact numbers is challenging due to their breeding and migratory behavior, as the monarch butterfly migrates every year long distances in a multi-generational migration that extends from Mexico to Canada. Like other pollinator species, the monarch butterfly's survival is threatened by climate change, the loss of native plants – milkweeds – and the rapid disappearance of their habitats. Scientists are collaborating with stakeholders to protect this species, including teaching the cryopreservation technique to researchers and breeders at the San Diego Zoo. In addition, they are working on extending the cryopreservation technique to cryopreserve spermatozoa from other endangered species, such as the Sacramento checkerspot butterfly, which is endemic to New Mexico. Grula, Research Biologist Arun Rajamohan, and Research Leader Joseph (Joe) P. Rinehart describe the technique in a study recently published in Scientific Reports.  “For people who are interested in helping monarch populations, they can plant common milkweed [Asclepias syriaca] in their yard, as this is utilized by monarchs for egg laying and larval diet,” added Grula.

As recently published in the scientific journal Ecosphere, the collaborative research effort among Agricultural Research Service (ARS) rangeland scientists at Burns, Oregon, and Fort Collins, Colorado, challenged the outdated dogma that livestock grazing in the sagebrush steppe always negatively impacts these ecosystems and, in fact, can convey desirable outcomes, particularly in regard to limiting both wildfire risk and invasive annual grasses. In addressing these ecological challenges, ARS scientists discovered that strategically applying livestock grazing prior to the occurrence of climate-induced wildfires can modify sagebrush steppe characteristics in ways that decrease fire probability and severity in the communities, promote biodiversity while reducing postfire annual grass invasion, fire-induced loss of native bunchgrasses, and fire damage to soil biocrusts, the collection of bacteria, fungi and mosses on the soil surface.

(Photo courtesy of Kirk Davies) The ARS team compared moderately grazed and ungrazed sagebrush steppe and observed the grazing induced shorter flame lengths, slower rates of fire spread, and smaller burning fronts. Similarly, strategic grazing in annual grass-dominated rangelands reduced flame length and rate of spread — modifications that resulted in safer and more effective fire suppression. Still another benefit of modified fire characteristics, the scientists reported, is a decrease in the area burned and overall mosaic of burned and unburned patches. Grazing by non-native livestock such as sheep, cattle and horses dates back to the mid-to-late 1800s by Europeans, these early practices were not ecologically sustainable and led to widespread overuse and degradation to include loss of perennial grasses and forbs, reduced biodiversity, erosion, overabundant unpalatable species, and non-native plant invasions. Fuel break created with strategically applied grazing in an invasive annual grass-dominated sagebrush steppe in southeastern Oregon. (Photo courtesy of Kirk Davies) “There were concerns about the negative consequences of non-native livestock grazing in sagebrush communities, especially since these communities are experiencing unpreceded threats from invasive annual grasses, altered fire regimes, and climate change,” said Kirk Davies, ARS rangeland scientist. “But strategically applied grazing can spur desirable social-ecological outcomes such as reduced non-native annual grass invasion, decreased wildfire probability and spread, reduced fire suppression cost, and prevent undesirable ecological transformation post-fire.” Davies’ findings also indicated that grazing can modify competitive relationships in introduced bunchgrass seeding to favor native species recruitment. This can be particularly valuable for reestablishing sagebrush, a critical shrub for many native wildlife species. With careful attention to the timing, duration, frequency, and intensity of use needed to meet vegetation objectives, strategic grazing has the potential to reduce the detrimental impacts of invasive annual grasses, promote native species in introduced grasslands, and encourage native shrub recovery. “Recognizing livestock grazing as a tool that can achieve desired outcomes could improve our ability to achieve meaningful rangeland management outcomes in sagebrush and likely other rangeland communities,” Davies said.

While modern production systems followed by U.S pork producers effectively minimize risk of exposure to this parasite, absence of Trichinella infection has never been verified through national testing. ARS researchers pursued this study to ascertain whether the PQA+ program eliminates the risk of Trichinella exposure in commercial pork, thereby addressing the demands of the U.S. export market. The U.S. Pork Quality Assurance Plus (PQA+) program is an education and certification program designed by the U.S. pork industry to help pig farmers and their employees continually improve production practices. The program addresses food safety, animal well-being, environmental stewardship, worker safety, and public health. Many of the provisions for mitigating risk of Trichinella exposure are based on research conducted by ARS scientists. PQA+ includes five best management practices for prevention of exposure to Trichinella: In the ARS study, a total of 3,208,643 animals across twelve processing locations were tested over a period of 54 months. Parasites were not detected in any of the diagnostic samples, providing a 95% confidence in a Trichinella prevalence of less than 1 in 1,000,000 pigs. The occurrence of Trichinella in pork once posed a major food safety risk in many countries, justifying decades of effort expended on controlling this parasite. The data obtained from testing support the conclusion that pork from pigs managed under the PQA+ program do not pose a public health risk. “The surveillance data support the assertion that the U.S. PQA+ program effectively mitigates risk for Trichinella infection in pigs,” said Dr. Benjamin Rosenthal, Research Leader of the ARS Animal Parasitic Disease Laboratory. “It is equally important to note that the data could be useful for future food safety decisions, including hazard analysis decisions.” PQA+ guidelines and implementation details follow those for controlled management described by the World Organization for Animal Health and guidelines of the International Commission on Trichinellosis. Eleven U.S. pork processing companies, including 30 locations in 12 states, participated in the survey. There are currently more than 63,000 U.S. pork producers certified under PQA+. This research, which is highlighted in this month’s issue of Food and Waterborne Parasitology, was supported by funding from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Agricultural Research Service, and the U.S. National Pork Producers Council.

Pectin, a soluble fiber used mainly for gelling food products like jams and jellies, is naturally found in fruits and vegetables. Most commercial pectins are from citrus fruit peels and are extracted into a powder to act as a gelling agent in foods. Orange peels used to make pectin. (Photo by Wei Zhao, ARS) “Most commercially-available pectins successfully gel only when combined with high sugar products and acid,” said Wei Zhao, a research chemist from the U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Florida. “For people seeking low sugar foods, most commercial pectins will not gel properly since a lot of sugar is needed for the gelling process. There are some commercial pectins that can gel in low sugar foods, but these alternatives tend to be low quality, are quite expensive to produce, and may contain undesirable residues.” Orange peels were shredded and then went through a simple high-pressure processing (HPP) treatment before being extracted for pectin. (Photo by Wei Zhao, ARS) In a recent study, Zhao and other ARS researchers found that they can pre-treat a fresh orange peel in a simple high-pressure processing (HPP) treatment and then extract pectin from that orange peel using a standard commercial method. The extracted pectin has desirable structural properties needed for gelling low sugar products without leaving undesirable residues. According to Zhao, the global market for pectin recently surpassed one billion dollars per year and is expected to reach over two billion dollars by 2025. The increasing demand for low sugar food products makes Zhao and her team’s pectin a desirable option for consumers. “Our research findings reveal the great potential of producing low-cost, high-quality pectins with increased gelling capacity by adding a simple HPP pre-treatment of fresh source material for pectin extraction,” said Zhao. The research findings were published in two journal papers in Food Hydrocolloids. Pectin extracted from a high-pressure processing (HPP) treated orange peel.

Beenome100 is a collaborative undertaking led by ARS and the University of Illinois, with collaboration of researchers across ARS and universities in the United States and Canada. The expectation is that these genomes will help researchers answer the big questions about bees, such as what genetic differences make a bee species more vulnerable to climate change or whether a bee species is likely to be more susceptible to a pesticide. Restricted to the eastern Mojave Desert, the Mojave poppy bee (Perdita meconis) is a solitary, mining bee of the Andrenidae family that specializes in pollinating the Las Vegas bearpoppy (Arctomecon californica) and the dwarf bearpoppy (Arctomecon humilis) — the latter being protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as of 1979. The poppies are found primarily in gypsum soil deposits, which are rare and scattered throughout the region. The Mojave poppy bee and Las Vegas bearpoppy are also being considered for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Both species will be evaluated for potential declining populations and vulnerability to extinction due to climate change and to habitat loss from urban development and mining in their native region. Researchers assembled the genome or genetic map that will help further to understand the Mojave poppy bee’s biological traits. A Mojave poppy bee female pinned specimen. (Photo by Michael Branstetter, ARS) ""The genome, with additional genetic sampling of individuals, will also potentially give us insights into the genetic basis for host-plant specialization, susceptibility to pesticides, and susceptibility to drought and climate tolerance,"" said Rena Schweizer, a research entomologist at the ARS Pollinating Insect-Biology, Management, Systematics Research Unit in Logan, Utah. In particular, the Mojave poppy bee is capable of weathering drought years by remaining in the ground in stasis — a phenomenon called diapause. The trait is not well understood by researchers and, by having its genome sequenced, they may be able to learn about the genes and regulatory pathways that make the adaptation possible. They will also use the genome to assess the species’ genetic health, find insights into how bees can be specialists or generalists, and look what the tradeoffs are in terms of a bee’s long-term fitness. ""It could also lead to us finding genetic signatures of decline,"" said Schweizer. ""By studying this one bee’s genome, we might be able to help conserve the bee better and identify other species that are in decline using genetic information."" A Mojave poppy bee male next to dime. (Photo by Chelsey Ritner, ARS) To develop the genome of the small and mighty bee, researchers isolated DNA from a single, small male specimen. This genome assembly, according to Schweizer, is impressive given that the bee is tiny (a male bee averages five to seven millimeters in length). Researchers collected the specimen in the field in a remote wilderness location.   ""What is also remarkable about this research is that the specimen used for the genome was collected in non-ideal preservation methods,"" said Schweizer. ""We still obtained high-quality DNA from a field-collected specimen due to technological advancements in sequencing technology and learned more about this unique bee. We hope that our research will set the groundwork for developing genomes of other bee species."" The detailed, high-resolution map of the reference genome is available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s database.

The Water Adaptation Techniques Atlas (WATA) consolidates over 200 case studies on research and practices that water managers and producers can use to find location-specific and topical information to make informed decisions regarding water management. Over the years, urban areas and agriculture have expanded in the Southwest region. For the past century, water use in the Southwest has been sustained through the capture, storage, and distribution of surface water, aided by dams, canals, and associated infrastructure, while extraction of groundwater has also intensified. However, water scarcity has become a pressing issue with extremely hot temperatures and severe prolonged droughts in a region already challenged by its arid and semi-arid conditions. As reservoir and aquifer levels drop, information about strategies to adapt to this new reality is urgently needed. WATA provides information based on research from USDA's Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and other sources about practices for lessening the gap between water demand and available supply, with an emphasis on cropping and irrigation practices across the Southwest, including Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. Agronomist Jim Smart and Mexican farmers Miguel Morales Beltran and Hector Rodriquez Mediola discuss the 1996 drought that caused this irrigation ditch near Rio Bravo, Mexico, to dry up. (Photo by Jack Dykinga). The solutions documented in WATA include centuries-old techniques employed by the indigenous peoples of the Southwest region to grow crops in arid lands, as well as novel technologies such as aquaponics (integrating fish and plant crop production) and agrivoltaics (integrating solar energy and crop production). Several cases highlight tools and technologies for matching irrigation application to plant water needs using soil moisture sensors, remote sensing, or weather data. Dissemination of information about adaptation options is critical, as individuals, organizations, and communities look to take proactive measures to adapt to climate change. Managers, researchers, and educators can use the case studies, research outcomes, and practices available in WATA to identify new strategies to help mitigate the effects of temporary water shortage and expected longer-term water scarcity.   The development of WATA is an ongoing collaborative project that started in 2020 among USDA-ARS, USDA Southwest Climate Hub, USDA California Climate Hub, UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences, and USDA’s Economic Research Service. Scientists will continue to incorporate new research findings and feedback from agricultural experts and others concerned with water scarcity in the Southwest.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences researchers studied the impact of pearl millet as a source of insect food by surveying insects collecting and consuming the sucrose-rich pollen of this crop. Researchers planted Tift Long-Headed Bulk, a type of pearl millet known for its long candlestick-like heads, at a research farm in Tifton, Georgia, during the past summer. According to the survey results, the most common insects observed feeding on Tift Long-Headed Bulk pearl millet were honey bees followed by lined earwigs, and maize calligrapher hover flies. Other pollinators such as two-spotted longhorn bees, common eastern bumble bees, American bumble bees, sweat bees, and two other species of hover flies also feasted on the crop.

(Photo by Karen Harris-Shultz, ARS) “What makes the study and the results fascinating is that wind-pollinated grasses, like pearl millet, are rarely promoted as a food source of pollinators in comparison to nectar-rich plants,” said Karen Harris-Shultz, a research geneticist at the ARS Crop Genetics and Breeding Research Unit on the UGA Tifton campus. “Our research shows that pollinators are utilizing grass pollen.” Harris-Shultz added that the study was also the first time that lined earwigs, banded cucumber beetles, two-spotted longhorn bees, and American bumble bees were observed collecting or consuming pollen from the pearl millet crop. ARS researchers in Tifton previously studied pearl millet as a food source for pollinators in 1965, but that study has not been revisited since, according to Harris-Shultz. Harris-Shultz and the researchers’ work focuses on bees and other pollinators of grasses, especially the turfgrass centipede grass and sorghum. The researchers took an interest in pearl millet because of its ability to thrive in areas characterized by drought, low soil fertility, and high temperatures. Bees collect pearl millet pollen.

These bees have limited time to perform a lot of pollination work and they can use all the help they can get! The USDA's Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS), Insect Genetics and Biochemistry Research, participated in a study led by the North Dakota State University, that aimed to provide insights on how to help solitary bees maximize their pollination performance and to aid pollination management. The study focused on the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) to determine how modifying the nesting cavity diameter of solitary bees can enhance bee conservation, performance, and management practices. The pollination work by this species of solitary bee is crucial for alfalfa seed production. There are more species of solitary bees than honeybees. Like honeybees, solitary bees are essential for pollinating crops and gardens, but unlike honeybees, they do not live in hives. Many solitary bees, like the alfalfa leafcutting bee, are cavity nesters and lay their eggs in natural cavities such as hollow twigs and holes in wood or digging underground tunnels. Before laying their eggs, the mother bee determines the required amount of provisions, gathers the supply of nectar and pollen, and places it in the individual nest cells. Then, eggs are laid on the provisions for the larvae’ development. Gardeners and bee managers help increase the number of bees by placing ""human-made"" nesting holes around gardens to help the bees with nest construction. Another method is the use of ""human-made"" nesting boxes, which are also commonly used in commercial pollination managers to synchronize the time pollinators emerge with crop bloom. An interesting fact is that the performance of solitary bees is not solely determined by their genetics but also by their body size. Furthermore, the size of the bee's body is influenced by the diameter of the nesting cavity and the amount of provisions left by the mother bee. Bees that grow larger inside the cavities have been shown to have a greater foraging distance, making them better at spreading pollen. Therefore, the size of the nesting holes can either limit or maximize the pollination performance of the offspring. So, how can we determine the correct size and diameter for bee-nesting to maximize the production capabilities of solitary bee offspring? An alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) on an alfalfa flower. This bee species is one of many wild bees called on to help honey bees pollinate the nation’s crops. (Photo by Peggy Greb, D1039-10). Scientists examined the adult body mass and provision size of the alfalfa leafcutting bee. They collected samples from nesting boxes placed in the field. The boxes offered cavities ranging in diameter from four to nine mm in one mm increments. After scientists examined all the measurements collected from the field nesting boxes, including the body sizes and provision measurements, they found that the size of the pollen provision was positively correlated to the bee's mass. They also observed that bees' body size increased as the diameter of the nesting cavity increased, reaching a maximum size in the bigger nesting cavity diameters, with offspring emerging from 8 and 9 mm having the highest rate of winter survival. In addition, the study found that various factors, such as gender, wing areas, wing loading, and overwintering, significantly influence the offspring when included in the analysis. The optimal nesting cavity size for the highest yield of offspring is 7 mm, while the best performance was observed in the 8 mm cavity. On the other hand, the 5 mm cavity could be the best option for the conservation of other cavity-nesting bees. As the different nest diameters impact each of these variables differently, pollination managers should carefully choose a cavity size that aligns with their primary management objective. “This study demonstrates the importance of different nest sizes for solitary bees,” said Research Leader Joe P. Rinehart, with the Insect Genetics and Biochemistry Research in Fargo, North Dakota.  “While larger nests result in larger bees that may be able to fly further, the medium nests produced more bees overall, and even bees from the smallest nests have the advantage of increased relative flight power, which means that they have the ability to carry relatively heavier loads than their larger counterparts.”  What is next?  Scientists will continue researching to find answers to additional questions, including more detailed studies on the costs and benefits of being a larger or smaller bee. The study was published in the Journal of Economic Entomology.

Her research focuses on studying the interactions between hosts and pathogens that are critical to disease pathogenesis and uses the findings to develop intervention strategies that can enhance host resistance, improve animal health and welfare, and promote the sustainability of animal agriculture. Dr. Workman led a multidisciplinary effort that resulted in the first gene-edited calf with resistance to bovine viral diarrhea virus, or BVDV. “Dr. Workman’s discovery is a significant breakthrough in livestock breeding technology that can improve animal welfare, promote the long-term sustainability of livestock production, and reduce the need for antibiotics in cattle,” said ARS Administrator Dr. Simon Liu. BVDV, a contagious and virulent disease, creates one of the biggest challenges to an $88 billion cattle industry. When beef and dairy cattle become infected with BVDV, they can develop respiratory disease, bloody diarrhea, mouth ulcers, and acute fevers. In addition, BVDV-infected pregnant cows can transmit the virus to their offspring, causing them to carry and shed the virus throughout their lives, which makes it even more challenging to control the disease. USDA-ARS research microbiologist Aspen Workman. (Photo courtesy of Aspen Workman) Scientists have been studying BVDV since the 1940s. In 2006, CD46 was identified as the main receptor on cattle cells that allows the virus to enter cells and cause disease. Building on this knowledge, Dr. Workman and her colleagues at USMARC, together with their industry partner, spent three years modifying the virus binding site on CD46 to block BVDV infection. By marking a targeted change to the virus receptor, Dr. Workman’s team produced a healthy calf that withstood a BVDV challenge, demonstrating for the first time that gene-editing can reduce or potentially eliminate the disease in cattle. Dr. Workman is also dedicated to promoting social equity inside and outside the laboratory. Her research in the laboratory focuses on addressing pressing social issues, such as finding ways to produce sustainable food to feed an ever-growing global population through improved disease detection, prevention, and control while supporting the mission of the ARS Animal Health national program. Dr. Workman's work goes beyond the laboratory. She serves on a committee for the National Academy of Sciences and actively engages at the high school and university levels in pursuit of her passion for advancing equity in laboratory science for the next generation of scientists and encouraging women to pursue research careers.

May 13 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/no-love-for-mealybug-menace-of-vineyards/,No Love for Mealybug Menace of Vineyards,Jan Suszkiw,Jan.Suszkiw@usda.gov,"Fake pheromones offer a way to foil the love lives of vine mealybugs and keep populations of these prolific, soft-bodied insect pests from reaching damaging levels in vineyards of wine, raisin and table grapes. Producing large amounts of the chemical insect sex attractants for release into the air to prevent lovelorn male mealybugs from finding females to mate with can be difficult and expensive. Now, however, clues to less costly synthetic pheromone alternatives are emerging from Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists’ studies of the pest’s olfactory system. Keeping vine mealybugs from meeting and mating is a big deal, considering they can produce multiple generations over the growing season. Unchecked, the pests suck sap from the grape plants, weakening them and reducing their fruit yields and quality. They also secrete honey dew, a waste that can drop onto grape clusters and promote the growth of black sooty mold—both of which can diminish the fruit’s marketability. Adding insult to injury, and perhaps most importantly, the pests also transmit a group of viruses that cause grape leafroll diseases. The presence of these viruses can necessitate the destruction of entire vineyards when infection rates hit 25 percent or higher. Using a genomic map of the vine mealybug together with sophisticated analytical procedures, the scientists discovered two key olfactory receptors (from among 50 total) that alert male mealybugs that love is in the air in the form of lavandulyl senecioate, the sole chemical constituent in a female’s pheromone. ARS scientists examine new ways to foil love lives of costly vineyard pest. (Photo by Jessica Griffiths, D3881-1) The receptors are so specific that no other known chemical odorant found in nature will prompt the males to take flight in search of females to mate with, noted Jacob Corcoran, an entomologist with the ARS Biological Control of Insects Research Laboratory in Columbia, Missouri. To confirm this specificity, Corcoran and colleague plant pathologist Walter Mahaffee at the ARS Horticultural Crops Disease and Pest Management Research Unit in Corvallis, Oregon, used a specialized cell line cultured in the lab to express (examine the function of) two of the vine mealybug’s olfactory receptors. Next, they exposed the cells to various doses of lavandulyl senecioate. This triggered the activation of cell signaling pathways indicating the receptors’ detection of the pheromone. The cells were also exposed to grapevine odors that the mealybugs normally find attractive in nature. However, no signaling pathways were activated, confirming the two receptors were highly specific to the sex pheromone compounds. With this method, the scientists have begun contemplating more diabolic ways to mess with the pest’s love life. On the one front, they envision using the method to screen for molecules called antagonists that could be used to deactivate the pest’s olfactory receptors in nature, preventing their detection of pheromone and dooming male vine mealybugs to a sad, lonely life of buggy bachelorhood. Or, in the reverse, proteins called agonists could be formulated to put the receptors in “overdrive,” compelling males to chase phantom pheromone signals where none exist. On yet another front, the researchers are pursuing the use of the olfactory receptors in biosensors—pheromone-sniffing devices that can be deployed throughout a vineyard to alert growers to where and when the pest’s numbers are on the rise so countermeasures can be timed accordingly. As the scientists see it, the use of pheromone-based tactics like mating disruption is part of a multi-pronged fight against the mealybug that includes the application of insecticides, organically compatible products like natural oils and biological or cultural control methods. Details on their latest advances on the anti-olfactory front against the pest were reported in the January 2024 issue of Current Research in Insect Science.

For cotton gin waste, the treasure is its hidden potential to transform silver ions into silver nanoparticles and create a new hybrid material that could be used to add antimicrobial properties to consumer products, like aerogels, packaging, or composites. Silver nanoparticles are highly sought-after products in the nanotechnology industry because of their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, electrical, and optical properties. These nanoparticles have an estimated global production of 500 tons per year and are widely applied to consumer goods such as textiles, coatings, paints, pigments, electronics, optics, and packaging. Cotton gin waste. (Photo by Sunghyun Nam) In a study published in ACS Omega, researchers from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) revealed the ability of cotton gin waste to synthesize and generate silver nanoparticles in the presence of silver ions. “Our method not only lets cotton gin waste act as chemical agents for producing silver nanoparticles, which makes it cost-effective and environmentally friendly but also enables embedding the nanoparticles within the cotton gin waste matrix,” said Sunghyun Nam, research engineer at ARS's Cotton Chemistry and Utilization Research Unit in New Orleans. “By embedding them in the cotton gin waste, these materials acquire antimicrobial properties.” Nam said the researchers used a simple heat treatment of cotton gin waste materials in water containing silver ions that produced silver nanoparticles without the need for additional chemical agents. Jacobs Jordan (left) shows a sample after nanoparticle synthesis, Sunghyun Nam (center) takes scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of cotton gin waste nanocomposites, and Michael Easson (right) shows cotton gin waste. (Photo by Michael Santiago Cintrón) This finding is significant since making silver nanoparticles usually requires chemical agents which can be costly and pose environmental concerns. Embedding nanoparticles into a material can also be challenging. Developing nanoparticle embedding technology is not new for Nam and her team. They previously developed washable antimicrobial wipes by using raw cotton fiber that produced silver nanoparticles inside the fiber. The embedded silver nanoparticles can continue to kill harmful bacteria wash after wash.  Large quantities of cotton gin waste are generated annually, and the cotton ginning industry is always seeking new sustainable processes that upcycle crop residue. “Our research paves the way for new material applications of cotton gin waste that can protect against microbial contamination,” said Nam. A provisional patent application on the self-embedding silver nanoparticle biomass waste compositions has recently been filed.

This analysis of gene expression is believed to be the first to compare the dormancy periods of this species in their natural habitat, and more importantly, it led to sequencing the first draft genome of this important pollinator for the almond industry. According to the U.S. Forest Service, North America has 140 species of Osmia. Osmia lignaria, a solitary bee, follows a one-year lifecycle that includes two periods of dormancy. During summer, the bee develops to the prepupal stage (the stage of larva after its final molt), pauses, then finishes to developing to the adult stage before winter. Adult bees slow their metabolic activity while overwintering [second dormancy]. When spring arrives, adult bees emerge from dormancy and become highly active in pollination. Although this species does not produce honey, it is very effective in pollinating almond trees due to cross-pollination among different varieties, which leads to higher crop yields. Osmia ribifloris is one of several relatives of the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria). These bees are effective pollinators for almond trees due to the way they cross-pollinate among different varieties, leading to higher crop yields. (Photo by Photo by Jack Dykinga) “This species inhabits a wide latitudinal range in North America, with populations in the north having different developmental rates and lengths of dormancy periods than those in southern populations,” said Alex Torson, a computational biologist with ARS’ Insect Genetics and Biochemistry Research in Fargo, North Dakota. “In the future, we can use the genome presented in this study to start comparing the genomes of individuals from these different geographic populations. If these differences in development and dormancy can be traced to their genetics, then we could develop managed populations from different geographic locations, and time the characteristics of those populations with peak floral blooms for different types of crops.”  By aligning their emergence with the timing of crops, it would allow for better management and pollination, as this bee species emerges in the spring and is a significant pollinator of almond trees due to how it pollinates. Understanding how this lifecycle occurs has become increasingly important due to changes in environmental conditions. A better understanding of the evolutionary relationships among populations of this species will be critical for developing managed populations we can use for pollination services.

This achievement reflects ARS' ongoing commitment to integrating the needs and practices of Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge into our research portfolio to support the priorities of tribal communities and indigenous agriculture.” ARS’ partnership with NHS College will improve seed health through multiplication, germination, and viability. It also includes data collection to determine the traditional use and characteristics of MHA Nation’s traditional varieties. This work is important for protecting seed intellectual property, providing data to support increased consumption, and demonstrating the link between traditional varieties and health while sharing cultural protocols and traditional ecological knowledge throughout the project. During the project’s first year, ARS researchers at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL) in Mandan, North Dakota, successfully grew a wide range of traditional crops necessary for seed and seedling distribution.  The yield included eight varieties of corn (totaling 28 gallons of corn seeds), seven varieties of squashes (totaling over 500 squashes), four varieties of beans (producing a half a gallon of seeds), and more than 150 of one variety of watermelon (over 150 watermelons) grown on half an acre.  Seed and seedlings of varieties of corn, squash beans, and watermelon [one variety]. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Ruth Plenty Sweetgrass-She Kills). The NHS College established a Project Advisory Team that includes representatives from each of the three Tribes. This team provides direction on strategies to increase the number of seeds, to determine seed distribution, to collect program data, and to integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge within the project. “By reconnecting the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people with our traditional seeds, we are bringing life back into the relationship between our seeds, our people, and our land,” said Dr. Ruth Plenty Sweetgrass-She Kills, Director of NHS College's Food Sovereignty Program. “This act of seed sovereignty also strengthens our Tribal food system and provides access to nutrient-dense foods that our people’s DNA recognizes and remembers.” Since 1998, NHS College has stewarded MHA traditional varieties through its Four Sisters Garden. NHS College’s traditional seed cache was established and has been maintained through donations by Tribal members and scholars and the rematriation [retrieval] of seeds from various institutions. In 1953, the Garrison Dam flooded the fertile agricultural land on Fort Berthold and forced MHA Nation Tribal members to re-establish new homes and communities on infertile dryland. This has contributed to the loss of cultural identity of MHA Nation tribe members, including the growth and consumption of their traditional crops. “Seeds need to be regrown at least every ten years to remain viable, as the viability of seeds decreases by about 10 percent each year,” said Dr. Claire Friedrichsen, an NGPRL research social scientist. “ARS’ role is to increase the health of seeds within NHS College’s traditional seed cache. This includes ensuring seeds are free from disease or rot, have limited disease susceptibility, and are free from other detrimental developmental conditions. Maintaining the health of seeds is important for the ability of a collection to continuously adapt to climate, land, and culture to produce healthy crops.” For inquiries regarding the distribution of new seeds, donations of old seeds that need to be grown to maintain their viability, or to become a member of the Nueta Hidatsa Project Advisory Team, email Dr. Ruth Plenty Sweetgrass-She Kills at NHS College at rhall@nhsc.edu.

This USDA-funded is a pilot project to create a roadmap for other Tribal institutions to collaborate with USDA ARS to support indigenous seed sovereignty.

These trees have been cultivated commercially for less than 150 years. It takes an average of 28 years from planting a new seedling to releasing a new pecan cultivar with traditional methods of pecan breeding. This is due to the long waiting period for pecan trees to start producing nuts, which takes up more than half of the time. With the new modernized laboratory, the Pecan Breeding and Genetics Program will now be able to incorporate genetic techniques into pecan breeding to accurately predict mature nut traits on young seedlings, saving up to a decade in the breeding process. Breeding new pecan cultivars is a lengthy process with long waiting periods of 7-10 years before a pecan tree can produce nuts and long testing phases to evaluate potential cultivars. It is challenging to support pecan breeding efforts due to their high resource demands and extended timelines, which make it impractical for private or commercial entities and challenging for academic programs. The event was hosted by USDA's ARS and the Texas Pecan Grower’s Association. ARS leaders, State Representatives, scientists, and members of the pecan industry organizations toured the new laboratory with now dedicated research spaces for plant genetics, microscopy, tissue culture, controlled-environment growth chambers, and plant disease research. ""Today marks the celebration of the opening of a new genetics and pathology laboratory,"" said Warren Chatwin, the Lead Scientist at the Pecan Breeding and Genetics Program in Somerville, Texas. ""This facility will enable ARS' researchers here at Somerville to advance pecan breeding and support modern genetics and plant disease research, which hasn't been possible since this site was established in the 1980s."" ""This event also highlights the significant impact of our stakeholders, the pecan industry organizations. They have unified their voice through the National Pecan Federation to express the need for increased quality, accuracy, and speed of pecan breeding, genetics, and plant disease research, leading to the establishment of this laboratory space. The success of our research is only possible through partnerships with stakeholders including the Texas Pecan Grower’s Association, which has provided decades of support and significant contributions, most recently through the National Pecan Federation,"" added Chatwin. The USDA Pecan Breeding and Genetics Program's new genetics and pathology laboratory meets biosafety containment standards and is equipped with modern research spaces that will advance pecan breeding, genetics, and plant disease studies. (Photos provided by Warren Chatwin, ARS). In addition, researchers will now be able to do controlled evaluations of promising breeding lines with different regional strains of pecan scab. Pecan scab, caused by the fungal pathogen Venturia effusa, is the most economically significant disease in the pecan industry and has high diversity across the geographic range of cultivated pecans. For the first time, the Pecan Breeding and Genetics Program will now be able to screen pecan scab cultures from all areas of the country in controlled environments to identify new sources of disease resistance and incorporate those unique samples into the breeding program. Researchers will also be able to do controlled evaluations for other significant and emerging pathogens of pecan, including the heavily quarantined international pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa. The Pecan Breeding and Genetics program has released 32 pecan cultivars to the industry, with notable releases like 'Pawnee,' which moved the commercial harvest window forward to mid-September, 'Lakota,' which has high scab resistance, and 'Wichita,' a high-yielding cultivar that performs well in the West.

A collaborative effort between scientists from the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Texas Tech University, Kansas State University, and West Texas A&M University work on reliable and repeatable liver abscess models to learn the triggers for this costly condition in cattle that not only negatively impacts animal well-being but also causes liver condemnations and may lead to increased carcass trimming and an overall decrease in profitability. The first successful model study, recently published in the Journal of Animal Science,  is part of a series of studies conducted at the USDA-ARS Livestock Issues Research Unit in Lubbock, Texas, that aim to find solutions to a problem of concern for animal well-being that is costing the industry millions of dollars. Cattle with liver abscesses can experience health problems and reduced growth and feed efficiency. However, cattle with liver abscesses don’t show clinical signs and are generally identified too late –at harvest. The economic losses associated with this condition in cattle can be as high as 400 million dollars annually. The knowledge gained from these models will help develop preventive interventions. ""After decades of studies, researchers haven't found an accurate way to predict nor diagnose liver abscesses, because of the complexity of the disease,"" said Rand Broadway, a research scientist with the Livestock Issues Research Unit. ""Our study is a huge collaborative effort between USDA and academic partners to develop a liver abscess model in cattle that can help us better understand how liver abscess formation begins. We are constantly learning about the causes and development of these abscesses.""  This model consistently showed a 50 percent prevalence, which is important for researchers to study liver abscess development and prevention strategies, particularly in calves entering the beef supply chain from dairy origin. In addition, the model continues to be improved in an effort to mimic “real-world” disease etiology while examining the physiological changes in the animal to better understand root causes of the disease.   Currently, the primary treatment to prevent liver abscesses in cattle has been in-feed antibiotics. However, antibiotics have come under more scrutiny by the general public, and alternatives to antibiotics are being sought. ""We are trying to ensure this model is effective and applicable to test non-antibiotic interventions in the future,"" added Broadway. ""We seek to use the knowledge gained from these models to develop different alternative interventions, such as nutrition management strategies."" In the study, scientists work with dairy and ‘beef-dairy’ cross steers, the population of cattle that most commonly suffer from this infection. They tested two diets (a high grain-based and forage-based) and three bacteria commonly found in liver abscesses [Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, Trueperella pyogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Lubbock]. The results from the high-grain diet model were found to be more reliable, leading scientists to focus more on this model. Most people associate liver abscesses in cattle with a high-energy diet. The theory is that when cattle are fed elevated grain levels, highly fermentable starch in the rumen is rapidly fermented by bacteria, causing a drop in rumen pH. This acidity causes damage to the rumen lining, allowing bacteria to travel into the blood, reaching the liver and other organs where they can cause infection. However, it is still unknown with accuracy the exact route that these bacteria take to cause infection or injury to the liver. Scientists discovered that the bacteria associated with liver abscesses in cattle may not always originate from the rumen. An alternative route may be bacterial travel from the lower gastrointestinal tract. The research showed that in some cases, when these bacteria were not detected in the acidic rumen environment caused by a high-grain diet, no liver abscesses were detected. However, when scientists introduced bacteria directly to the rumen, they observed the formation of liver abscesses and were able to isolate the bacteria from the infected sites. The study confirms that an acidotic diet, combined with bacterial inoculation in the rumen, can be used as a model to induce liver abscesses. However, further research is being conducted at USDA to determine the consistency of the model before it can be used to evaluate new interventions to prevent this complex infection.

However, viruses, including DWV, are linked to the deaths of millions of colonies worldwide. DWV, like other viruses, is most often spread by Varroa mites who carry the disease inside them and infect bee colonies. Infection typically causes deformity and death in bees, especially in the pupae and brood. These colony losses devastate beekeeping industries and pose a major risk to agriculture and the global food supply. While there are medicines for other bee diseases and parasites, there is currently no treatment available to help beekeepers reduce viruses in their colonies. Nearly all colonies have DWV and can often be infected with multiple viruses at any given time. Effective antiviral treatments could help to improve colony health and survival as well as crop pollination efficiency. ""We found that engineered algae diets suppressed DWV infection and improved survival in honey bees,"" said Vincent Ricigliano, research scientist at the ARS Honey Bee Laboratory in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""When mixed into bee food, the engineered algae boost the bee’s immune system to fight off the targeted virus."" Honey bees feed on a pollen patty containing microalgae. (Photo by Vincent Ricigliano, ARS) According to Ricigliano, blue-green algae is the ""bee’s knees"" of bee food additives. Ricigliano and other ARS researchers previously studied blue-green microscopic algae, also known as microalgae, as a potential food source for honey bees. The algae showed promise since it has a nutritional profile that resembles pollen and is scalable to the level of commercial beekeeping. ""In addition to the nutritional benefits and immune-boosting effects, engineered algae strains have the potential to protect bees against a wide variety of pathogens,"" said Ricigliano. Blue-green algae grow via photosynthesis and can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making it an ecologically friendly approach to improve the health of honey bees. ""This technology represents a potential new class of treatments for honey bees that is highly sustainable and scalable,"" said Ricigliano. ""It can be added directly to supplemental feed without additional processing and easily integrated into beekeepers’ existing management practices. However, there are regulatory considerations that must be addressed before these applications can be fully realized."" The researchers filed a patent application for the technology and plan to use variations of it to target additional bee viruses and other pathogens in future studies.

February 28 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/new-discovery-speeds-scientists-push-for-hlb-tolerant-citrus/,New Discovery Speeds Scientists’ Push for HLB-Tolerant Citrus,Jan Suszkiw,Jan.Suszkiw@usda.gov,"It’s one thing for a hybrid citrus tree to tolerate citrus greening disease (a.k.a. Huanglongbing) and quite another if it also produces orange-like fruit—especially if the juice makes for a delicious breakfast beverage! Now, that holy grail of traits could be closer at hand, thanks to the chemical and genetic sleuthing of a team of Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) scientists. Huanglongbing (HLB) was first detected in Florida’s Miami-Dade County in 2005. The disease has since spread throughout Florida, threatening a citrus industry there that contributes nearly $7 billion to the state’s economy and employs more than 32,000 individuals. The disease also poses a threat to other U.S. citrus-growing areas, including California, Louisiana and Texas. In Florida, sweet oranges like Valencia, Hamlin and Midsweet are the main varieties used to make orange juice. However, sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) is highly susceptible to HLB, which is caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and transmitted by insects called Asian citrus psyllids. The disease causes citrus trees to become unproductive and fruit quality to decline. In sweet oranges, for example, the fruit of diseased trees tend to stay green and produce bitter-tasting juice, which diminishes their marketability but poses no consumer danger. Infected trees cannot currently be cured. Scientists are investigating countermeasures on multiple fronts in hopes of providing the Sunshine State—which went from producing nearly 80 percent of U.S. non-tangerine citrus fruit to less than 42 percent—with a ray of hope. ARS efforts indirectly took root in the 1960s, when agency scientists created citrus hybrids using a relative named Poncirus trifoliata (the cold-hardy trifoliate orange) to shore up the trees’ cold tolerance. The start of the HLB epidemic more than four decades later revealed something else: the hybrids also appeared to tolerate the new disease, prompting intensive research by ARS and the UF/IFAS to understand why and how this related to fruit quality. Initial field tests and flavor evaluations showed that some of the Poncirus-derived hybrids—with the notable exception of US Sundragon—tended to produce juice with an undesirable off-flavor but aroma profiles similar to sweet orange. So, the scientists re-assessed their approach. They decided that, in addition to using data from analyses of juice-aroma compounds, they needed to get a better handle on the individual chemicals that give orange juice its characteristic flavor. And they did just that, identifying 26 total flavor compounds and seven chemicals called esters deemed essential to the desired flavor profile of orange juice. A genetic discovery by ARS and University of Florida scientists could speed the search for hybrid citrus trees that tolerate citrus greening disease and produce orange-like fruit ideal for making juice. (Photo by David Bartels, USDA) That advance, in turn, enabled the team to pinpoint the esters’ master gene, CsAAT1, and make what’s known as a DNA marker for it—a tool that can be used to quickly check for the genetic presence of a desirable trait in germinated seeds versus observing its physical expression in 10- or 15-year-old mature plants. “Breeders can use this DNA marker to screen seedlings for desired flavor profiles at an early stage,” explain Anne Plotto and Jinhe Bai, plant physiologists with the ARS Citrus and Other Subtropical Products Research Unit in Fort Pierce, Florida. “By incorporating this gene into the genetic makeup of HLB-tolerant hybrids derived from Poncirus trifoliata and mandarin, or from many other possible crosses with the same objective, breeders can ensure that these new hybrids not only possess HLB tolerance but also maintain the characteristic sweet orange flavor.” A full description of the team’s approach was published February 28, 2024 in the journal Science Advances. Plotto and Bai, the principal investigators, co-authored the paper together with 11 other collaborators from ARS’ U.S. Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Florida, and Daniel K. Inouye U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii, and UF/IFAS’ Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred, Florida, and Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Balm, Florida. The researchers caution that even with the use of high-tech tools like machine-learning, the first commercial releases of orange-like hybrids with HLB tolerance will be contingent on several more years of testing and refinement. Nonetheless, “this research represents a significant step in citrus breeding, combining traditional techniques with modern genetic tools,” said Plotto and Bai. “The approach could also serve as a model for other crop improvement programs,” they added.

The results of the study published in Nutrients show that the benefit of butyrate is specific to the cell line studied and is apoptosis-dependent, a process of gene-directed cell death (this a molecular mechanism that plays a crucial role in removing damaged or mutated cells selectively from tissues in an orderly manner.) Diet composition is among several factors that can contribute to the prevention of colon cancer. Consuming a healthy diet that is high in fiber and low in saturated fat can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, a community of microorganisms, including bacteria, that live in the human gastrointestinal tract. The large intestine, commonly known as the colon, hosts a diverse group of bacteria that play a significant role in breaking down fiber and non-digestible carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty acids (like butyrate) during the process. These fatty acids serve as the main energy source for normal colonic cells, reduce intestinal inflammation, and help increase bacterial diversity, therefore improving colon health. A healthy balance of gut microbes can significantly reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as colonic inflammation and cancer. ""This study provides a greater understanding of butyrate and how it inhibits colon cancer cell growth at the molecular level,"" said Huawei Zeng, a research molecular biologist with the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, North Dakota. ""Findings show that the inhibitory efficacy of butyrate against colon cancer cells is cell type-specific, which may partially explain its anticancer property and clinical variability."" The data collected from the findings of this research with butyrate will help the team of scientists in an upcoming five-year project. The project focuses on the impact of lentil consumption on colon health in models of obesity. ""Lentils are an excellent source of dietary fiber and bioactive compounds that can benefit our health,"" said Zeng. We are currently working on a multi-year project that aims to examine the connection between butyrate and lentil's dietary fiber. This will help us develop robust lab analyses to evaluate the beneficial effects of each lentil variety on colon health before we proceed to do in vivo research outside of the laboratory."" A comprehensive review led by Zeng was published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences on the progress in knowledge concerning the effects of short-chain fatty acids on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome. The recently published study provided valuable insights to scientists. Still, more studies are needed to fully understand the potential of butyrate in fighting cancer cells.

Despite their appearance in everyday meals and snacks, the truth is that raw eggs and egg products can carry Salmonella and cause foodborne illness and outbreaks, and even death, in some circumstances. But researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently found a way to combat this through Radio Frequency (R.F.) technology. A simple solution to foodborne pathogens in eggs would be to pasteurize all raw eggs before they are consumed; however, less than 3 percent of commercial eggs are pasteurized in the United States. Conventional thermal pasteurization of intact eggs is usually a long process that involves submerging eggs in hot water for more than 57 minutes to inactivate Salmonella cells. Researchers at the  Agricultural Research Service's (USDA-ARS) Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pa., used a novel thermal technology that pasteurizes eggs and inactivates Salmonella cells with a short processing time. During the study, the water molecules inside the egg rotate and align with the RF instrument’s electric field. This molecular friction causes the liquid inside the egg to heat up quickly and subsequently reduce Salmonella by 99.999 percent within 24 minutes. The R.F.-processed eggs were transferred to the refrigerator and kept at 7°C for seven days to simulate the commercial cold chain temperature. Radio frequency unit. (Photo by Joseph Sites, ARS) ""After treatment with the system, no intact Salmonella or sub-lethal Salmonella cell remnants were recovered, and no cell recovery was found in the R.F. - treated eggs when stored at retail refrigerated temperature,"" said USDA-ARS Research Food Technologist Daniela Bermudez-Aguirre. ""The egg quality, such as the color and other parameters, were also preserved through the processing."" This technology has shown several advantages when used in food, all without a negative effect on food quality. Statistics also show that Americans consumed a total amount of 93.1 billion eggs in 2023. So, this is a promising advancement for small farmers or egg processors and can ensure food-safe eggs while minimizing Salmonella. Consumers will also benefit from this technology since it preserves the quality of the eggs that can be used for special markets such as nursing homes, hospitals, or schools. ARS researchers will continue to develop this technology’s capabilities and expect it to be commercially available in the near future.

Who can resist a strawberry from the fields on a late spring day? Especially when it is bursting with flavor and can be incorporated into smoothies, desserts, syrups, preserves or just a raw, healthy snack. The truth is that not many can turn down a fresh strawberry. That's why the Agricultural Research Service's (USDA-ARS) strawberry breeding program in Beltsville, Md. is shaking up your Valentine's Day with news of a new cultivar called USDA Lumina that produces lustrous bright red strawberries that are large and sweet. Early research results quickly showed that 'USDA Lumina' consistently provided high yields of large, sweet, boldly colored, and glossy strawberries that were marketable in the earliest part of the Mid-Atlantic strawberry season. They're also relatively resistant to foliar diseases present in the field leading to low rot at harvest, as well as during postharvest storage. (Photo by USDA, ARS) Anthracnose fruit rot routinely destroys a high percentage of strawberries grown during the traditional season and can even occur during cold storage. The plant disease favors hot, humid, rainy weather, but 'USDA Lumina' is unique in that there has been little to no evidence of anthracnose affecting the cultivar. ""No fumigation or fungicides were used on 'USDA Lumina' in the field,"" said USDA-ARS research plant geneticist Kim Lewers. ""This is remarkable. Our research shows that after two weeks in post-harvest storage, 'USDA Lumina' fruits were 24 percent more marketable than its early-season predecessor."" 'USDA Lumina' is expected to be adapted to the Mid-Atlantic region of the US and regions with a similar climate. The strawberry's excellent shelf life is just an added benefit to the taste, that has been described as sweet with a notable creamy texture. While most Mid-Atlantic strawberries yield fruit in mid to late May, 'USDA Lumina' debuts earlier in the season and provides its delicious berry in late April to early May. The cultivar was approved for release in 2023 and will soon be patented. Distribution during the life of the patent is limited to requestors licensed to propagate. Licensing information can be obtained through the USDA-ARS Office of Technology Transfer.

February 5 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/usda-develops-cold-hardiness-kiwifruit-for-immediate-release-to-public/,USDA Develops Cold-Hardiness Kiwifruit for Immediate Release to Public,Autumn Canaday,Email not found,"Kiwifruit and their tangy green flesh are routinely purchased and devoured throughout the year by people across the nation. This is no surprise. Kiwis are high in Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and potassium. The subtropical fruit is also a favorite of many southern U.S. producers since the delicious fruit is traditionally grown in warmer climates. California produces the vast majority of kiwis that are sold in our local grocery stores, but due to recent research advancements from U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists, this may no longer be the case. This was not a snap decision. The research actually began in 1995 when scientists from the Agricultural Research Service’s Appalachian Fruit Research Service (AFRS) planted second-generation seedlings that originated in Rome, Italy. Only two vines survived the cold winter temperatures between 1995 and 2015, with a record low temperature during that period of –5.8 F. Of those two vines, 'Tango' (female) and 'Hombre' (male) were planted and evaluated in the AFRS’orchards before a new crop proved that these particular cultivars could grow and thrive in traditional Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern winter climates. In a recently published study, researchers noted that both vines grew vigorously, and received little pruning before bearing fruit. There was also no need for supplemental irrigation, fertilizer, pesticides, or a warm climate for growth. Kiwis grown at the Appalachian Fruit Research Station. (Photo by Mark Demuth, ARS) ""This cultivar isn’t currently found in the grocery store,"" said Research Biologist Scientist Chris Dardick. ""The flesh and texture are very similar to the kiwifruit that people already enjoy and so is the flavor. It’s easy to grow, extremely pest and disease resistant, and readily available for use by producers and nurseries in colder climate conditions."" Tango’s fruit yields high quality in terms of size and soluble solids and are comparable to the commercial A. deliciosa cultivar Hayward.  It can also remain in cold storage for extended periods of time. The male pollinizer 'Hombre' is not patented and can be publicly made available upon request. The female kiwi 'Tango' is patented by the USDA-ARS and can be distributed to nurseries or producers once they obtain a licensing agreement. Both plants ('Hombre' and 'Tango') are essential to produce the kiwifruit. Limited quantities of budwood and/or plants from 'Tango' and 'Hombre' are also available upon request for evaluation.

S. iniae is the causative agent of streptococcosis, a disease prevalent in aquaculture and causes a worldwide economic loss of $150 million annually. Disease outbreaks can bankrupt fish farms and put farmers at risk of getting the disease when handling infected fish. Current vaccines provide only short-term protection for S. iniae, and fish farmers more often rely on antibiotics to treat the disease. ARS scientists aimed to develop a natural treatment since antimicrobial resistance — a process when germs like bacteria and fungi develop the ability to fight drugs designed to kill them — is a major concern for aquaculture farmers when treating bacterial diseases.

Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center in Stuttgart, Arkansas. ""According to our study’s results, this protein effectively cures S. iniae infectionsinhybrid striped bass."" According to Deshotel, the protein, known as ClyX-2, showed a 95 percent survival rate for the fish in the treatment groups in comparison to the 5 percent survival rate of fish in the control groups during the study. The results showed that the protein was statistically as effective at treating S. iniae as antibiotic treatments like carbenicillin (85 percent cure rate). In the future, Deshotel and the researchers plan to study how to treat water to prevent diseases caused by S. iniae before they can infect fish. The recent study, published in Fish & Shellfish Immunology, was conducted in partnership with the USDA-ARS and Daniel Nelson from the University of Maryland’s Department of Veterinary Medicine.

January 18 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/how-might-tomatoes-provide-health-benefits/,How Might Tomatoes Provide Health Benefits?,Maribel Alonso,Maribel.Alonso@usda.gov,"Scientists at U.S. the Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and The Ohio State University (OSU) have been working to investigate how tomatoes may be imparting health benefits in a recently published study. Studies in animals have shown that incorporating tomatoes into the diet can reduce the prevalence of chronic illnesses like prostate and liver cancer. It has been thought that compounds naturally produced by tomatoes are responsible for these effects. After absorption from a meal, many of the chemical compounds found in tomato fruits travel to the liver, where they are metabolized. Some compounds remain for some time, while others are quickly removed from the body. Meanwhile, in the liver or other tissues, some of these compounds can alter gene expression in ways associated with positive health benefits. Researchers in the past have largely focused on lycopene, a pigment that gives tomatoes their red color. However, tomatoes produce thousands of compounds, and it has been shown that tomato consumption offers more benefits than lycopene alone. A “big picture” view was missing. “We know that eating tomatoes is associated with a number of health benefits, and our study intended to dive deeper into what happens when you eat tomatoes from the standpoint of what is absorbed and how gene expression is altered,” said Michael Dzakovich Ph.D., a scientist with USDA-ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center. “Rather than focusing only on one compound, we utilized a technology called metabolomics to broadly profile how hundreds of chemical compounds were changing in the liver as a result of tomato consumption. We also used transcriptomics to measure how all the detectable genes in the liver were changing at the same time. This approach gave us valuable insight into the potential mechanisms by which tomato consumption affects the liver and potentially the whole body.” Scientists tested liver tissue from mice that were fed control diets or control diets enriched with tomato to determine what tomato compounds were found in the liver and how gene expression changed. Tomato-fed mice were given one of two diets with the addition of commercial orange and red tomato varieties. Since not all tomato varieties are chemically identical, using multiple varieties allowed for a more comprehensive examination of how tomato consumption affects the liver in general. (USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.) ""We discovered a series of metabolites [molecules produced by metabolism] that have never been reported in the liver. Several of these compounds have been found in blood, skin, and urine, but our data show that these molecules are more extensively metabolized than we realized,"" stated Dzakovich. The metabolites are from steroidal alkaloids uniquely produced in tomatoes. ""Steroidal alkaloids have been shown in both in vitro [in the laboratory] and animal studies to lower the absorption of cholesterol, reduce cancer cell proliferation, and reduce muscle atrophy. They also resemble many important signaling molecules made by the body. It seems reasonable to hypothesize they might be a part of a suite of compounds found in tomatoes that benefit human health."" In addition, scientists observed that regardless of the tomato variety, there was an increase in the activation of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism, a series of biological processes that help our body detoxify itself. This led the authors to hypothesize that one way in which tomatoes may be benefiting human health is in their ability to promote production of the enzymes that allow excretion of potentially toxic compounds. Similar gene expression profiles have been associated with the prevention of cancer development because of consuming vegetables like brassicas (for example, broccoli). Michael Dzakovich initiated this study during his Ph.D. program in the laboratory of Jessica Cooperstone Ph.D. at The Ohio State University in collaboration with Mallory Goggans MS, Jennifer Thomas-Ahner Ph.D., Nancy Moran Ph.D., Steven Clinton MD Ph.D., and David Francis Ph.D. More details about this study can be found in Molecular Nutrition and Food Research.

Potatoes are one of the main crops grown in the U.S., with a production of approximately 22.5 million tons annually. Fall is the primary season for harvesting potatoes, accounting for 90 percent of the total production. Since many locations cannot support year-round potato cultivation, most potatoes intended for processing, such as frozen french fries or instant mashed potatoes, are harvested in the fall and safely stored until needed. Storing and maintaining potatoes at their top nutritional quality while meeting consumer and market demands is essential for the industry. Yet, potato producers face several critical challenges, including climate- and disease-related challenges during crop production and long-term storage. Maintenance of post-harvest quality is of prime concern to the potato industry because post-harvest crop losses through physiological and disease-related processes routinely reach 10-15 percent. These challenges include factors such as early sprouting, as well as slow wound-healing of potato tubers inadvertently damaged during the operational process. Tubers of four Russet potato cultivars (Russet Burbank, Umatilla Russet, Bannock Russet, Dakota Russet) are being monitored under controlled environmental conditions for dormancy progression and sprout growth patterns during postharvest storage. (Photo by Munevver Dogramaci, USDA-ARS, Fargo, ND.) Have you opened your home pantry and found potatoes sprouting? Immediately after harvest and for an indeterminate period thereafter, potato tubers are physiologically dormant and will not sprout even when they are placed in growth promoting conditions. The length of tuber dormancy period is determined by the genetics of the potato cultivar, and environmental conditions during the crop production and post-harvest storage—including temperature, humidity, light, and air composition. Premature sprouting or incomplete wound-healing adversely affects potato processing quality and nutritional value, resulting in lower producer prices or even complete market rejection by the industry and fresh market. Munevver Dogramaci, a research plant physiologist and lead scientist of the Potato Research Program at the Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, and Darrin Haagenson research plant physiologist at the Potato Research Worksite in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, collaborate with growers and universities to address  these post-harvest physiological challenges, as well as to evaluate advanced potato breeding material for postharvest storage, food quality, and safety characteristics. ""Currently, there is no method that is 100 percent efficient to control the physical deterioration of the potato tubers during storage,"" said Dogramaci. ""Potato tubers are at their peak nutritional quality during harvest, but it is essential to store them under specific conditions to maintain this quality."" A better understanding of physiological processes will help scientists improve post-harvest storage methods, preserving nutritional value, processing quality, and the marketability of potatoes. Dogramaci also noted that unintended wounding of tubers, like cuts and bruises, can also occur during harvest and post-harvest operations. ""This results in rapid quality loss that impacts the tuber's texture, ability to retain water, and an increase in its susceptibility to diseases during storage,"" Dogramaci explained. Paul J. Collins, a research geneticist for the ARS Eastern potato breeding program based in Orono and Presque Isle, Maine, is working to develop new varieties for chip processing and table markets with improved agronomic attributes, disease resistance, climate resiliency, and quality traits. Successful varieties developed by this program include Atlantic, a variety that is widely grown across the U.S. for potato chips and is within the top ten most popular potato varieties grown in the nation. ""Potato breeding seeks to identify new potato varieties that can provide benefits throughout the value chain,"" said Collins. ""Farmers can benefit from disease resistance traits, resilience to climate variability, and improved yields. Processors and retailers are interested in maintaining quality and uniformity. Consumers are driven by improved nutrition and flavor. Within the breeding program, we see huge variability for all of these traits. The challenge and fun of potato breeding is finding a new variety which makes everyone in the value chain happy.""  Want to learn more? Watch the latest episode of ""Cooking with Science""!

January 8 2024,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2024/genetic-sleuthing-reveals-new-weakness-in-corn-s-herbicide-armor/,Genetic Sleuthing Reveals New Weakness in Corn’s Herbicide Armor,Jan Suszkiw,Jan.Suszkiw@usda.gov,"A team of Agricultural Research Service (ARS), university and industry scientists has spotted a new genetic vulnerability to tolpyralate herbicide in 49 varieties of corn, marking the first report of the weed control posing a danger to the staple crop. The finding, reported in the December issue of Pest Management Science, will enable farmers to avoid crop losses, such as by choosing a tolpyralate-tolerant variety or by using a different herbicide product. According to Marty Williams, an ecologist with the ARS Global Change and Photosynthesis Research Unit in Urbana, Illinois, tolpyralate was registered in 2017 and labeled for use in fallow fields and on all types of field-, pop- and- sweet corn. It belongs to a class of herbicides known as HPPD (4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitors. When applied as a post-emergent herbicide, tolpyralate triggers a biochemical chain of events in targeted weeds that initially causes bleached-appearing leaves and then ultimately plant death.  Normally, corn plants can quickly metabolize (break down) HPPD inhibitor herbicides before they inflict the same kind of harm. The process depends on the presence or absence of certain types of alleles (alternate gene copies) in a region of their genome known as NSF1. One way that corn breeders check for the alleles during evaluations of new candidate varieties is to spray them with nicosulfuron. It is an ALS (acetolactate synthase enzyme)-inhibiting herbicide that can also serve as a reliable indicator of a variety’s sensitivity to several types of post-emergence herbicides, including most ALS and HPPD inhibitors. As it turns out, however, spraying nicosulfuron isn’t a reliable indicator of corn tolerance to tolpyralate. A team led by ARS ecologist Marty Williams (pictured here) showed that spraying certain sweet corn varieties with tolpyralate herbicide can injure the crop rather than help it contend with weeds. (Photo by Peggy Greb, D1914-1). That’s what Williams and his collaborators from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Illinois Foundation Seed Inc. learned after conducting a series of greenhouse, field and laboratory tests using genetic mapping techniques. They began their investigation in late summer 2021, after a corn breeder’s report that spraying tolpyralate onto a sweet corn inbred line called XSEN187 had severely damaged all plants. But instead of the alleles they expected to see, the team traced the sweet corn inbred line’s tolpyralate sensitivity to a cluster of genes residing on a unique region of chromosome 5. This was confirmed by the alleles’ association with visible tolpyralate damage in two populations of offspring plants that were derived from crosses between the sweet corn inbred and two tolerant corn lines. The researchers expanded the scope of their investigation, ultimately identifying tolpyralate sensitivity in a total of six types of field corn and 43 types of sweet corn. Additional screening is likely to detect the trait in other varieties as well. Consider the case of the inbred line IL677a, which was used to introduce the widely popular sugary enhancer gene to sweet corn. In tests, the line proved severely sensitive to tolpyralate, raising the possibility that this sensitivity was also widely introduced into sweet corn along with the sugar enhancer trait. Importantly, the researchers also showed that tolpyralate sensitivity in the corn lines they evaluated is contingent upon exposure to oil-based adjuvants, additives that are mixed into herbicide tanks before application. However, removing them isn’t an option, Williams noted. The adjuvants are key to ensuring the herbicide is absorbed into the leaves of targeted weeds, killing them more effectively. How exactly the newly identified gene or genes on chromosome 5 make these varieties vulnerable to harm from tolpyralate hasn’t been figured out yet. ""We need a greater understanding of the physiological mechanism so that the manufacturer and seed companies can reduce the risk of crop injury, such as by improving crop tolerance to the herbicide,"" Williams said. ""Moreover, the research may have application beyond tolpyralate, because several new HPPD-inhibiting herbicides are being developed from the same pyrazole ring scaffold as tolpyralate.""
